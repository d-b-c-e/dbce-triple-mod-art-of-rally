> This repository is archived for historical source, documentation and existing release downloads. Its source history through `f8b0f816cd3bdbe9db3c251f31b3e8d59933d37a` is preserved in the combined repository. Use the [combined setup guide](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-mods-art-of-rally/blob/main/docs/GAME-SETUP.md) and [combined issue tracker](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-mods-art-of-rally/issues) for current work. The existing **0.3.11** release remains available below; consolidation does not make unreleased 0.3.12 source an accepted release.


Angle-correct left, center, and right views for [art of rally](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/). Use one wide NVIDIA Surround display or three separate Windows displays. The mod includes its own screen setup and field-of-view control; **Triple Screen Optimizer is optional**.

**[Download 0.3.11](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-triple-mod-art-of-rally/releases/tag/v0.3.11)** · [Setup guide](docs/SETUP.md) · [Known issues](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

Version **0.3.11** is a playable prototype tested on the Steam game build **1.5.8b** with Unity Mod Manager (UMM) **0.27.0**. The separate-display drive had aligned seams, stable vegetation, matched lighting, and no visible tearing on the tested rig. A later Surround drive showed much better vegetation and lighting with the viewport renderer, but **tearing remains an open issue in Surround**. See [known issues](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md) before installing.

The current source is preparing **0.3.12** with an **Override field of view** toggle. Turn it off to follow the game's live camera FOV on all three screens; turn it on to use the saved slider value. The attended Surround drive confirmed the game-FOV mode and aligned seams. Switching back to the saved slider value still needs an attended check. This candidate is not in the 0.3.11 download.

## Install

For the 64-bit Windows game. You need art of rally and UMM 0.27.0 or newer; no SDK, optimizer, or other mod is required to play.

1. Close the game. Download and extract [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21), run `UnityModManager.exe`, select **Art of Rally**, and click **Install** if you have not already.
2. Download **DbceTripleScreenArtOfRally-0.3.11.zip** from the [release Assets](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-triple-mod-art-of-rally/releases/tag/v0.3.11). Choose the mod ZIP, not GitHub's source-code ZIP.
3. Extract the whole ZIP and double-click **Install.bat**. It finds Steam libraries, verifies the files, and preserves existing mod settings. You can also drag the ZIP onto UMM's Mods tab.
4. Launch through Steam and press **Ctrl+F10** to open UMM. Find **DBCE triple-screen for art of rally**, open its settings, and choose an output mode.

The installer also supports a custom folder: `Install.bat -GameDir "D:\Games\artofrally"`. Updating is the same as installing. To remove the mod, close the game and run `Uninstall.bat`; saved measurements, other mods, and UMM remain. [Detailed setup](docs/SETUP.md) covers both display modes and a source build.

## Set up your screens

In **Advanced setup and diagnostics**, enter one panel's pixel width/height and visible physical width/height, your eye distance, and the angle of each side screen. Select **Use these measurements**. The example values in the fields are inactive until you accept them. An existing optimizer layout can supply measurements instead; the optimizer itself is not needed.

| Mode | Windows setup | What the mod draws |
|---|---|---|
| **Off** | Any | The game's normal camera. |
| **Single wide display** | One display exactly three panels wide, such as NVIDIA Surround | Three camera viewports across the wide output. |
| **Three separate displays** | Extended desktop, equal native resolutions, center monitor set as Windows primary | A camera on each Unity display. |

The **Field of view** slider changes all three views together. **Reset field of view** returns to the entered measurements. Set or change the Windows display mode while the game is closed. In separate-display mode, Unity keeps the side windows activated until the game exits, so restart after changing modes. The tested display mapping was center `0`, left `1`, right `2`; Unity may number your side displays differently.

The mod also offers an optional center-menu setting for wide output. Gameplay, stage-finish cinematics, and FOV continuity were exercised on the owner's rig. Replay, photo mode, every menu, other monitor arrangements, and long-term performance still need broader testing.

## Known issue: Surround tearing

The attended Surround run showed visible tearing even though Unity requested VSync 1 at 7680×1440 and roughly 59 updates/s. Those values do not prove synchronized scanout across the panels. No visible tearing was reported in the separate-display drive. The comparison with stock Surround was not completed, so the cause is still undetermined. [Known issues and workarounds](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md).

## Build from source

The source is independent of the private toolkit. You need .NET 8 SDK, a local game installation, and UMM installed for that game because the build references their assemblies without copying them into this repository. Set `ART_OF_RALLY_DIR` to the folder containing `artofrally.exe`, then run:

```powershell
dotnet build Dbce.TripleScreen.sln -c Release
dotnet run --project tests/Dbce.TripleScreen.Core.Tests -c Release --no-build
```

Alternatively, pass `-p:GameDir="D:\Games\artofrally"` to the build. To produce a checked release ZIP, run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/package/Package.ps1 -GameDir "D:\Games\artofrally"`. [Building and packaging details](docs/BUILDING.md).
